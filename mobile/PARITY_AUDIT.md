5. **Loyalty Display** - Full tier/points/history
6. **Gift Card Support** - Balance check and redemption
7. **Payment Flow** - Complete Stripe integration
8. **Order History** - View past transactions

### P2 - Staff Enablement
9. **Staff Role Detection** - Route to staff screens
10. **Order Processing** - Accept/prepare/complete orders
11. **QR Scanning** - Validate tickets/gift cards
12. **Table Management** - View assigned tables

### P3 - Enhanced Experience
13. **Push Notifications** - Requires dev build
14. **Password Reset** - Forgot password flow
15. **OAuth Login** - Google/Facebook buttons
16. **Coupon Application** - At checkout

## Implementation Estimate

| Phase | Scope | Estimated Effort |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| P0 - Core Customer | Profile, Menu, Orders | 3-4 days |
| P1 - Full Customer | Loyalty, Gifts, Payments | 3-4 days |
| P2 - Staff | Order processing, QR scan | 4-5 days |
| P3 - Polish | Notifications, OAuth, Reset | 2-3 days |
| **Total** | | **12-16 days** |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on P0 first** - The app must have core transactional functionality before release
2. **Use existing API** - All required endpoints exist in the backend
3. **Reuse web patterns** - Follow same UX flows as web for consistency
4. **QR scanning** - Use `expo-camera` and `expo-barcode-scanner`
5. **Push notifications** - Requires EAS dev build (not Expo Go)
6. **Staff features** - Essential for operational value of the app

---

## Conclusion

The mobile app has a solid foundation (auth, navigation, UI components) but lacks the transactional features that make it useful. Without menu viewing, ordering, and booking capabilities, the app cannot be released to customers.

**Current Parity: ~35%**  
**Target for MVP: ~80%** (Customer flows complete)  
**Target for Full Parity: ~95%** (Staff + Manager flows)
